There is no point in buying an iPhone, if you are overanalysing your decision.

You will **ENJOY** your money when you can buy things you like --- without feeling the pinch of spending on it.

You don't need a finance coach to tell you all this.

You will always enjoy your money, if you are spending it wisely.

If the process of spending creates stress, you already know that is not a wise expenditure.

This is not finance, this is common sense.

Waiting for a stock market fall? You might have to wait longer.

While I can't predict whether markets will rise/fall, I can help you understand better: why markets rose in the first place.

- Pre COVID, we were at 12,500 NIFTY levels.
- The markets fell to roughly 8500.
- Then went up to 18K after a year.

Now, we are at 25,000. And despite COVID, we have generated roughly **125% returns** from NIFTY 50 in the last 5 years.

These are better than average returns.

### Now, comes the question: why did we make so much returns?

1. Better economy? No (for context: last year the best performing stock market in the world was Pakistan. Look at its economy).
2. More optimism? Possibly.
3. Real reason is: more liquidity.

For context: US, in 1 year, added 20% of its existing money supply. When money is added at such volume into the economy, the price for EVERYTHING appreciates.

When the US prints more USD, it flows to the world because most of the world trade happens in USD.

As people get more USD, they buy more assets. Therefore:

- Gold doubled.
- Real Estate doubled.
- Stock Markets doubled.

This will all look like a good thing (yes, it is for some). But this also increases your rent, your school fee, your petrol prices, etc.

### What happens in the next 5 years?

The FED recently cut the interest rates (to increase more liquidity). This is an indication that they want to pump in even more money into the economy right now.

In economic terms: your asset prices (stocks, RE, gold, etc.) are likely to go up. And, so would the inflation.

People who invest would continue to benefit.
People who don't would pay the price for inflation.

1. Most customers are not kind to their service providers.
2. Hence, most service providers need to be ruthless to survive.
3. Hence, they stop being kind to their employees.
4. The employees feel no loyalty in a ruthless market.
5. And, we all name this **Capitalism**.

Capitalism can be kind. And it could benefit ALL. If someone breaks this trap and becomes kinder to start with.

It is heartbreaking to see young, hardworking folks taking their own lives due to work pressure.

Schools and colleges prepare us academically (maybe). But they don't really prepare us to deal with the corporate environment.

Real life is very different from books.

1. When you get a job after years of hard work (college grind, getting good marks, internships, finally a job).
2. You don't really want to lose it.
3. The very thought of losing something that you got after so much struggle makes us go through absolute abuse sometimes:
   - Work 18 hours: yeah, sure no problem.
   - Work on weekends: yeah, sure no problem.
   - Available at 11 PM to chat about work? yeah, sure no problem.

Like many of you, I have personally been through this.

It is easy to say:

- Corporates should change their policies (or XYZ).
- Government should do PQR.
- Or individuals should not get desperate.

But practically, speaking: in India, there is a massive supply of talent. And not enough jobs to absorb them.

People raise their hands and say: fine, make me work 12 hours, I will take it. I will keep doing this as long as I have a decent job.

All this sounds depressing. And maybe it is. But this does not mean that you don't have options, and you keep taking abuse.

1. If you are feeling desperate in your job, try speaking with your seniors who left the firm. Take advice from them. They can guide you a lot.
2. Switch to a lesser-paying job.
3. Talk to your parents: your parents will be okay with you taking a 30% dip in your salary for a happier life.

Even if you lose your job: there is enough help around (your old classmates, friends, alumni network, etc.). At the very least: stop considering your work as life.

When we are young, we are gullible. We tie our prestige (and even our life!) to our jobs, and that creates massive mental pressure.

Start having a life outside your work.
Nothing in the world is worth your life.

I had a surreal fan moment when Manisha Parihar and I bumped into Akshat Shrivastava, Ayushi Chand, and their kids at the Burj Khalifa!

I’d been hoping to meet Akshat during my last trip to Goa, so spotting him in Dubai felt like hitting the jackpot of serendipity. Akshat and Ayushi were incredibly gracious, inviting us for a quick chat where we exchanged pleasantries and shared a few laughs.

Since May 2021, I’ve been an avid follower of Akshat’s investment wisdom and crisp content. His insights have been instrumental in guiding me toward financial independence and future planning, and they’ve sparked an eagerness to learn even more from him.

I’m thrilled to say I’ve put his teachings into practice—embracing conscious investing, launching an Airbnb in Varkala with Shivani Rathi (come visit us at [Beach Oh! Beach](https://beachohbeach.com)), and even relocating to a tax-free country.

Meeting Akshat at the foot of the world’s tallest building was the perfect cherry on top of my Dubai adventure!

My friend bought a stock at 1.25Rs. And now, it is 22Rs. He made crazy returns.  
I asked him: how much did you invest?  
"Oh, I invested very little. Wish I had invested more."  

Here is the point that most people don't get about investing:

1. If your net worth is 1 Crore, you buy a stock worth 5000. And, it goes 20X, it doesn't make a dent on your net worth.
2. But, if your net worth is 1 Crore, you buy a stock worth 5 Lakhs. And, the stock goes 2X, it makes a 10% difference to your net worth.

People focus too much on 20X, 30X-- but focus very little on what percentage of your net worth you are investing in assets you trust.  
For doing that, you need knowledge. Most people "gamble," not "invest" in the stock markets.

Cities like Bangkok/Hanoi/Kuala Lumpur are cheaper than Mumbai to live. A few years ago, India was an inexpensive country.  
When you traveled to countries like Thailand, Vietnam, etc., you always felt that: "oh wow, India is quite inexpensive."  
That is NOT the case anymore. So what changed? Two things:

1. The cost of Real Estate has gone up massively. The price for almost everything is tied to Real Estate (e.g., your burger costs more) because some shop is paying a higher rent than it used to. Why? Because property prices have gone up. Due to this, the rent has gone up. Due to this, your burger prices have gone up. This applies to school fees, retail shops, etc.
2. The supply chains have improved. And, the highest bidders get access to the best quality assets. A classic case study would be Malaysia. Here, the rent is low, but the food prices are quite high. Why? Because Singapore is next to Malaysia. If I, as a trader, have a choice to sell my goods to Singapore vs. Malaysia, I will sell to where I am getting the most money.
3. In India, we are witnessing a unique situation: due to high corruption, our Real Estate prices are crazy (for context: Mumbai beats Dubai in terms of Per Square Feet rates, which makes no sense). And due to improved supply chains: if you wish to consume good things, you gotta pay the same price on consumption goods.

Add to this: we are a high-tax country-- so when you buy discretionary items (e.g., Cars), the cost adds up fast.  
In short, there are two Indias:

- One where 50% of people depend on food rations. For them, the cost of living does not escalate much.
- Two, where 20-30% of people crave better things (better education, healthcare, cars, houses). For them, India is becoming like Dubai (minus the tax advantages).

Here is the Mutual Fund portfolio I built publicly around 1.25 years back. I made close to 4.5 Crores in profits.  
Before you get excited about making crores, let me share some honest lessons with you that I have learned along the way:

1. Without big capital, you are very unlikely to make big money.
2. Leaving your job to do stock markets full-time is a recipe for disaster. Focus on your job to build an income. Invest that income to build wealth.
3. Unless you learn about stock markets fundamentally, you won't have the real courage to put 60-70% of your net worth in the markets.
4. The real change in your wealth happens ONLY when you have the courage to put a big chunk of your NET WORTH into a high-growth asset (like stocks). - Putting 5 Lakhs, when your net worth is 1 Crore, won't make any difference - But putting 70 Lakhs, when your net worth is 1 Crore, will create a massive change.
5. To do #4, you need courage. Courage comes from knowledge.
6. Almost all this MF was bought in bulk (no SIPs, nothing), 95% Index funds.
7. This means that I saved on at least 0.5-1% commissions, compared to an average investor in Mutual Funds.
8. You might ask: what difference would a 1% commission make? Well, it makes a lot of difference: for example:
   - A SIP of 25K, for 40 years: 
     - At 11% gives you = 21.69 Crore 
     - At 12% gives you = 29.7 Crore
     
That is almost 37% difference in wealth if you are a long-term investor.

9. If you do not invest more in bad times, you will never make above-market returns. If you chase the markets in good times, you will almost always make below-market returns.
10. Since I have a fairly decent-sized portfolio, I do have hedges, and most of my positions are in direct equities (not in MF) because it is easier to do hedging there. Risk management is the #1 rule of building a big portfolio.

I am sharing these notes to help you get started. I invested most of this money when the markets were sideways.  
I saw a good cycle: part luck, part courage. To make my next set of big returns, I need to play another cycle.

- *I sold SmallCap 250 entirely (hence, my profits notional + real comes out to around 4.5Cr).*
- **I don't do SIP, buy/forget, etc. I invest when opportunities are there.**

Tell people facts, they think it is some scare tactic. Facts:

1. The % of taxes paid by the middle-class white-collar job is de-facto the highest.
2. The FDs (post inflation adjustment) are giving the lowest returns.
3. Segmental inflation in the economy is the highest for the middle class.
4. Our savings rates are at a 5-decade low.
5. We are seeing the highest HNI migration (as a % of HNI, within the country) now.

If you step back, there are many issues you can solve for "yourself."  
For example, in India, to even preserve wealth, you need to take risks. (Choose your asset class, you are comfortable with).  
Am I forcing you to take risks? No. But think about it: you work 9-to-5, for what?  
For most folks, it's for earning money (so that they can have a better future).

How does your wealth really grow if the inflation for YOU (Segmental inflation) is growing at 10%, but your wealth growth post-tax is like 5-6%?  
Anyone telling you these facts is your friend, not your foe.

How much money do you need to retire in India?

1. **Okay, let's start with 2 Crores.**  
   - You put this in an FD.  
   - Pay 30% tax (roughly), you make after tax 4.5%.  
   - Inflation is 4-6% (official).  
   - You lose money really fast. Can't retire.

2. **How about 10 Crores?**  
   - You put it in an EPF/PF/PPF.  
   - Grow at 8% after tax.  
   - Inflation for your segment might be 10% (e.g., private healthcare, education for kids, etc.).  
   - Again, you are losing money each year.

3. **How about 100 Crores?**  
   - You put it in the stock market.  
   - Grow it at 12%.  
   - Beat segmental inflation.  
   
   After 30 years, it's time to reap rewards, but the government comes and imposes a 30% LTCG.  
   What does the excel you built when you were 30, tell you now?

Point is: retirement is a moving number.  
You need a big enough corpus, control your inflation (your lifestyle growth rate), and control your exit tax.

Is it easy to do? Absolutely not. But, this is the real deal.  
Speak with anyone who has made 100Cr of wealth, they will all tell you the same thing: hedge your bets.  
And, avoid a single point of failure. Applies to investing, careers, life.
