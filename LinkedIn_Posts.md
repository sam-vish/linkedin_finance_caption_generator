There is no point in buying an iPhone, if you are overanalysing your decision.

You will **ENJOY** your money when you can buy things you like --- without feeling the pinch of spending on it.

You don't need a finance coach to tell you all this.

You will always enjoy your money, if you are spending it wisely.

If the process of spending creates stress, you already know that is not a wise expenditure.

This is not finance, this is common sense.

Waiting for a stock market fall? You might have to wait longer.

While I can't predict whether markets will rise/fall, I can help you understand better: why markets rose in the first place.

- Pre COVID, we were at 12,500 NIFTY levels.
- The markets fell to roughly 8500.
- Then went up to 18K after a year.

Now, we are at 25,000. And despite COVID, we have generated roughly **125% returns** from NIFTY 50 in the last 5 years.

These are better than average returns.

### Now, comes the question: why did we make so much returns?

1. Better economy? No (for context: last year the best performing stock market in the world was Pakistan. Look at its economy).
2. More optimism? Possibly.
3. Real reason is: more liquidity.

For context: US, in 1 year, added 20% of its existing money supply. When money is added at such volume into the economy, the price for EVERYTHING appreciates.

When the US prints more USD, it flows to the world because most of the world trade happens in USD.

As people get more USD, they buy more assets. Therefore:

- Gold doubled.
- Real Estate doubled.
- Stock Markets doubled.

This will all look like a good thing (yes, it is for some). But this also increases your rent, your school fee, your petrol prices, etc.

### What happens in the next 5 years?

The FED recently cut the interest rates (to increase more liquidity). This is an indication that they want to pump in even more money into the economy right now.

In economic terms: your asset prices (stocks, RE, gold, etc.) are likely to go up. And, so would the inflation.

People who invest would continue to benefit.
People who don't would pay the price for inflation.

1. Most customers are not kind to their service providers.
2. Hence, most service providers need to be ruthless to survive.
3. Hence, they stop being kind to their employees.
4. The employees feel no loyalty in a ruthless market.
5. And, we all name this **Capitalism**.

Capitalism can be kind. And it could benefit ALL. If someone breaks this trap and becomes kinder to start with.

It is heartbreaking to see young, hardworking folks taking their own lives due to work pressure.

Schools and colleges prepare us academically (maybe). But they don't really prepare us to deal with the corporate environment.

Real life is very different from books.

1. When you get a job after years of hard work (college grind, getting good marks, internships, finally a job).
2. You don't really want to lose it.
3. The very thought of losing something that you got after so much struggle makes us go through absolute abuse sometimes:
   - Work 18 hours: yeah, sure no problem.
   - Work on weekends: yeah, sure no problem.
   - Available at 11 PM to chat about work? yeah, sure no problem.

Like many of you, I have personally been through this.

It is easy to say:

- Corporates should change their policies (or XYZ).
- Government should do PQR.
- Or individuals should not get desperate.

But practically, speaking: in India, there is a massive supply of talent. And not enough jobs to absorb them.

People raise their hands and say: fine, make me work 12 hours, I will take it. I will keep doing this as long as I have a decent job.

All this sounds depressing. And maybe it is. But this does not mean that you don't have options, and you keep taking abuse.

1. If you are feeling desperate in your job, try speaking with your seniors who left the firm. Take advice from them. They can guide you a lot.
2. Switch to a lesser-paying job.
3. Talk to your parents: your parents will be okay with you taking a 30% dip in your salary for a happier life.

Even if you lose your job: there is enough help around (your old classmates, friends, alumni network, etc.). At the very least: stop considering your work as life.

When we are young, we are gullible. We tie our prestige (and even our life!) to our jobs, and that creates massive mental pressure.

Start having a life outside your work.
Nothing in the world is worth your life.

I had a surreal fan moment when Manisha Parihar and I bumped into Akshat Shrivastava, Ayushi Chand, and their kids at the Burj Khalifa!

I’d been hoping to meet Akshat during my last trip to Goa, so spotting him in Dubai felt like hitting the jackpot of serendipity. Akshat and Ayushi were incredibly gracious, inviting us for a quick chat where we exchanged pleasantries and shared a few laughs.

Since May 2021, I’ve been an avid follower of Akshat’s investment wisdom and crisp content. His insights have been instrumental in guiding me toward financial independence and future planning, and they’ve sparked an eagerness to learn even more from him.

I’m thrilled to say I’ve put his teachings into practice—embracing conscious investing, launching an Airbnb in Varkala with Shivani Rathi (come visit us at [Beach Oh! Beach](https://beachohbeach.com)), and even relocating to a tax-free country.

Meeting Akshat at the foot of the world’s tallest building was the perfect cherry on top of my Dubai adventure!
